# Microbial Cell Detection with YOLOv8

This project implements a web application for real-time detection and segmentation of microbial cells using the YOLOv8 deep learning model.

## Overview

Microbial cell detection is essential in various fields, including environmental monitoring, public health, and biotechnology. This application provides a user-friendly interface for researchers and practitioners to quickly and accurately identify microbial cells in images.
